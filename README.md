# Hi there 👋

I'm Marcos, an enthusiastic developer. I've been working as a full-stack developer lately but frontend has a sweet spot in my heart.

## Background

I've been working as a web developer since more than 8 years now. I usually introduce myself as a Full-stack developer, but since that definition is a bit all over the place, a clarification would be that I'm mostly a 60% frontend 40% backend.

I've been told that my github activity from May 2023 to April 2025 is not justified by the repositories on my account, and that would be correct, since most of what's displayed on the github activity grid is about my work at [2U / edX](https://rigoli.dev/jobs/2u-edx). I've had the privilege of working on a company with Open Source repositories, this allows me to shar my work with whoever is intersted.

This is mostly the breakdown:

### edX

- **AI Spot / AI Aside**: Generative AI service that uses OpenAI to summarize media ( text, video, etc.). This allowed students to hit a button and get a summary on the current course content.

> **Stack**: Python + Django (Backend) and ReactJS (Frontend). - [[See PRs](https://github.com/edx/ai-aside/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arijuma)]

- **Learning Assistant**: Backend for an AI chat tool that uses OpenAI that allows students to ask questions in the scope of a course.

> **Stack:** Python + Django. - [[See PRs](https://github.com/edx/learning-assistant/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arijuma)]

- **Frontend Lib Learning Assistant:** Frontend side of the Learning Assistant.

The platform is written in Python and JavaScript and makes extensive use of the Django framework. At the highest level, the platform is composed of a monolith, some independently deployable applications (IDAs), and micro-frontends (MFEs) based on the ReactJS.
