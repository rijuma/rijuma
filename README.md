# Hi there 👋

I'm Marcos, an enthusiastic developer. I've been working as a web developer since more than 10 years now. I usually introduce myself as a Full-stack developer, but since that definition is a bit all over the place, a clarification would be that I'm mostly a 55% frontend 45% backend.

## Side projects

- [ctxhelpr](https://github.com/rijuma/ctxhelpr) - An open source local MCP server for coding agents that indexes repositories, helping build context for tasks spending less tokens and time.
- [ts-coding-challenges](https://github.com/rijuma/ts-coding-challenges) - A small collection of typescript challenges. There is a lot out there, I just wanted to make a collection of my own with the ones I've found more interesting.

## Hobbies
